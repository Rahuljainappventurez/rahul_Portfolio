        What is a paragraph? Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many
        students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of
        at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In
        reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is
        what constitutes a paragraph.
